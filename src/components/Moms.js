                Gaby sells her Christmas decorations every year to help pay for that year's presents.
                    Covid has put a stop to the arts and crafts fair but not Gaby. She wanted a simple site 
                    that would act as a catalog and provide a direct means of communication. Using flexbox 
                    and a few media queries, I made it is fully responsive for mobile and a section that allows 
                    customers to send an email directly to gaby without leaving the home screen.
